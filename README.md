# Refresher on MVC

## Overview

We'll review the Model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm and how Rails implements
it.

## Objectives

1. List advantages created by compartmentalizing an application's functionality
2. Identify Model-View-Controller roles within a simplified example
3. Identify Model-View-Controller roles within Rails' implementation of the paradigm

## Foreword

Within the curriculum, you have been working hard learning defined, small-scale
technical concepts, problems, and solutions. You've been "zoomed in" to the
details of learning programming. In this README we will "zoom out" to think
about software _architecture_. For this lesson, we are assuming the mindset of
a [_software architect_][software_architect]. Software architects, most likely
your senior collaborator as you enter the workforce, don't focus on making a
piece of code work ("Hm, should I use `.each` or `.map`?"). Rather, they are
focused on making design decisions which allow for ease of change,
extensibility and avoidance of bugs.

MVC was created as a general purpose solution designed to  bridge the gap
between a user's mental model of a program and a computer's _actual_
implementation. As we have been unknowing 'users' of the MVC pattern most of
our lives, we need to change our perspective to understand it as programmers.
When considering interfaces using the MVC pattern, the most critical shift in
perspective to recognize is that the MVC pattern _helps separate concerns_.

## Separation of Concerns

At its core, MVC is designed to modularize distinct functionality within an
application. While the MVC pattern can be used with many different types of
applications, let's identify its distinct parts in the context of a web
application:

* ```View```: what an end user on a website experiences when interacting with
  a program in their browser: what they read, what they click, what flashes
  at them, what they hear (despite the name "view"). In technology-speak, the
  vocuabulary word would be _interface_
* ```Model```: where the actual data, (be it information about restaurants,
  train times, or rare marsupials), resides and is altered
* ```Controller```: what manages communication between the two: it takes
  model information and prepares it for the view and vice versa

Now that we have identified the core components, let's examine what they
actually do when a user engages with our web application:

1. A user, through interaction with the ```view```, (in this case, the browser's GUI), requests data (clicks on a link, submits a form, enters a URL in the browser's bar
2. The request is sent across the internet to the server
3. The ```controller``` (_which does not change data itself!_) asks the ```model``` to either provide it data (which it will send) or to change model-held data depending on the user's request
4. The ```model``` accesses/manipulates the actual 1's and 0's held on the server's database and returns the desired result to the ```controller```
5. The ```controller``` packs the response and sends it back to the client
6. The ```view``` (on the originating client's machine) _presents_ the data for the user

In considering the above steps, try to answer the following question:

* Do the **model** and **view** have any actual direct interaction?
* Is the data represented in the ```view```, that the user sees and interacts with, anything but a virtual copy of the _actual_ data a user perceives they are interacting with?

### An Advantage of Modularity

Earlier in this README, we said that we would practice thinking like a
"software architect." Let's pursue that further.  Imagine that the system we
just described was applied to a banking system. You open a browser to your
bank's site, you make requests to view your account balances, you make requests
to transfer money between accounts.

Lo and behold a new device comes out, it's called a Smartphone! People can now
use their PHONES to access the INTERNET! Thanks to the MVC architecture, the
bank only has to build a new "View," that is, an iPhone application.

Oh my goodness! Amazon invents a new home device that talks to you! Again, the
bank only needs to write a new view (or "interface") that can leverage the
pre-existing architecture of the bank's controller and models, so long as it
can send information across the Internet.

Remember, we said that _software architects_ focus  on making design decisions
which allow for ease of change, extensibility and avoidance of bugs.  For every
new device, we write new-device-only code (i.e.  View code) which **cannot**
introduce bugs into the pre-existing Model or Controller code. It's because of
design patterns like this that 1970's banking software is still holding your
account data while you view and manipulate it with 21st century technology.

## Quick Recap

###### MVC is designed to:

* Be language- and application- agnostic
* Be modular: every part is distinct, encapsulated, and can be replaced without breaking the rest of the application
* Use a ```controller``` to facilitate communication between the ```view```, (which the user interfaces with), and the ```model```
* Stores 'truth', the _actual data_, in the ```model```, which is far abstracted and independent from its representation in the ```view```

## Where Rails Fits In

Rails takes architectural guidance on how to separate concerns from the MVC pattern.  Like most implementations of academic or philosophical ideals, Rails's implementation is not to-the-letter perfect MVC. That's OK.  Consider the textbook definition of apple pie crust, the textbook definition describes exact ratios of salt, sugar, fats, etc. But my implementation might be different than Avi's implementation. Is mine less correct? Is his less correct?  There's room for intelligent discourse and discovery of what's appropriate to the constraints.

#### Rails MVC Implementation

The ```controller``` and ```model``` implementations in Rails are straightforward to align with our understanding of MVC.

Not only are they named helpfully and live in helpfully-named directories like `models/` and `controllers/`,  but they encapsulate their responsibilities as perscribed in the MVC architecture. The controller actions mediate requests and delegate lookups by calling methods on ```models```. As expected, ```models``` work with the low-level persistent storage subsystems (e.g. databases) to UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE data in the database. The Rails views are templates for displaying data. They are automatically turned to HTML that is sent over the internet by Rails. However, the data they need to "complete" themselves is provided by the controller. Rails "automagically" shares any variable prefixed with `@` in a controller action with the view.

*ASIDE*: Some feel that this "magic" is "bad." DHH feels that this "magic" is "good." Reasonable programmers can disagree over the advantages and disadvantages of this choise. However, since DHH created Rails and runs the project, his opinion is the one implemented.

## Summary

* The MVC paradigm is a language- and application-agnostic pattern for separating concerns
* MVC describes an architecture of three modularized parts: ```model```, ```controller```, ```view```
* While Rails emulates the majority of an MVC structure, it is not a perfect "textbook" match &mdash; _by design_!
